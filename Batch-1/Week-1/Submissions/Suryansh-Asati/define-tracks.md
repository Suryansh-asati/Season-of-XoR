# Selected Track – AI/ML  

I’m deeply fascinated by **Artificial Intelligence** and how machines can learn from data, adapt through trial and error, and improve with feedback (*reinforcement learning*).  

I want to dive deeper into this field by building **hands-on projects**, completing **structured tasks**, and learning from the broader **AI/ML community**.  

By joining the **Season of XoR** program, I’ve chosen the **AI/ML track** to strengthen my skills, gain practical exposure, and contribute to impactful solutions powered by intelligent systems.
